# finalYearProject
My final year project in university. A sales, order and booking system. The database was originally on Azure and I only had access to it for the duration of the project, the script of the database isn't the final one used at the end of this project but it is the most recent version that I have.

- CRUD of: 
  - Discount
  - Client profile
  - Workshop venue
  - Workshop type
  - Workshop host
  - Workshop slot
  - Products
  - Inventory items
  - Policy
